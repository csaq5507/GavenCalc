Continuous Integration
----------------------

### Concept

Continuous Integration is a development practice where several developers can upload code into a shared repository multiple times a day. Each so called check in is verified by a system, which helps the team to detect problems early.

### Benefits

* Say goodbye to long and tense integrations
* Increase visibility which enables greater communication
* Catch issues fast and nip them in the bud
* Spend less time debugging and more time adding features
* Proceed in the confidence you’re building on a solid foundation
* Stop waiting to find out if your code’s going to work
* Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly

### Drawbacks

* More responsibilities
